top -p $(pgrep -f "python3 main.py")

# Reduce threading for memory-constrained environments
python3 main.py -t target.com --threads 5
```

**Timeout Issues**: Slow targets may require timeout adjustments:

```bash
# Increase timeouts for slow targets
python3 main.py -t target.com --timeout 120

# Use custom configuration with extended timeouts
```

### Debugging Techniques

#### Verbose Logging

Enable comprehensive logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Maximum verbosity
python3 main.py -t target.com --verbose --log-level DEBUG

# Log to file for analysis
python3 main.py -t target.com --verbose 2>&1 | tee scan.log
```

#### Component Testing

Test individual components to isolate issues:

```bash
# Test reconnaissance only
python3 main.py -t target.com --recon-only

# Test specific tools
nmap -sS -sV target.com
nuclei -target target.com
```

#### Configuration Validation

Validate configuration settings:

```bash
# Test configuration loading
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('modules')
from config.settings import Config
config = Config('config/my_config.yaml')
print('Configuration loaded successfully')
print(f'AI enabled: {config.is_ai_enabled()}')
"
```

### Performance Troubleshooting

#### Slow Scanning Performance

**Thread Optimization**: Adjust threading based on system capabilities:

```bash
# Test different thread counts
python3 main.py -t target.com --threads 10
python3 main.py -t target.com --threads 20
python3 main.py -t target.com --threads 50
```

**Network Optimization**: Optimize network settings for target characteristics:

```bash
# Reduce timeouts for responsive targets
python3 main.py -t target.com --timeout 10

# Increase delays for rate-limited targets
# (configure in YAML file)
```

#### Memory Usage Issues

**Memory Monitoring**: Monitor memory usage during scans:

```bash
# Monitor memory usage
watch -n 5 'ps aux | grep python3 | grep main.py'

# Use memory profiling tools
python3 -m memory_profiler main.py -t target.com
```

**Memory Optimization**: Implement memory optimization strategies:

```bash
# Process targets in smaller batches
split -l 10 large_targets.txt batch_
for batch in batch_*; do
    python3 main.py -f $batch --batch-mode
done
```

### Error Recovery

#### Graceful Failure Handling

The tool implements comprehensive error recovery mechanisms:

**Partial Results**: Even when some components fail, partial results are preserved and reported.

**Retry Logic**: Automatic retry logic handles temporary failures and network issues.

**Fallback Mechanisms**: Fallback mechanisms ensure core functionality remains available even when optional components fail.

#### Data Recovery

**Result Preservation**: Scan results are preserved even when the tool encounters errors:

```bash
# Check for partial results
ls -la reports/
cat reports/bug_hunter_raw_*.json
```

**Log Analysis**: Comprehensive logs enable post-incident analysis:

```bash
# Analyze error logs
grep -i error logs/bug_hunter_*.log
grep -i warning logs/bug_hunter_*.log
```
